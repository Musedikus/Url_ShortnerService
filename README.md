# Library Management System

A simple and secure ASP.NET Core Web API for managing books in a library. Built using Clean Architecture, JWT authentication, and full CRUD support for users and books.

---

##Feature..............................................................................

- âœ… User Registration & Login with JWT
- âœ… Secure password hashing using BCrypt
- âœ… JWT token versioning for invalidation on logout
- âœ… CRUD operations for books
- âœ… Search & pagination support for books
- âœ… Global exception handling middleware
- âœ… Consistent API responses using `ResultModel<T>`
- âœ… Swagger UI with JWT authorization support
- âœ… Seed data on startup (books + test user)

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture..........................................................................

Follows Clean Architecture with the following layers:

- `Domain`: Entity models
- `Application`: DTOs, interfaces, services
- `Infrastructure`: EF Core + repositories + Unit of Work
- `API`: Controllers, JWT logic, DI setup, middleware

### ðŸ§© Patterns Used..........................................................................

- Repository + Unit of Work
- DTO and Response Wrappers
- Global Error Handling Middleware
- Dependency Injection
- OpenAPI (Swagger) with JWT Auth

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack...........................................................................

- .NET 6 / ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- BCrypt.Net for hashing
- Swagger / OpenAPI

## ðŸš€ Getting Started......................................................................

### 1. **Clone the Project**
 âœ… git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LibraryManagementSystem.git
 **NOTE**: Navigate to src/API folder and Open appsettings.Development.json and update the DefaultConnection string to your local SQL Server
        Ensure your SQL Server (e.g. via SSMS) is running before moving to **step 2**
        
### 2. **Navigate to API Folder**
cd LibraryManagementSystem/src/API

### 3. **Running the project**
  -First run command "dotnet restore"
  -Then run command "dotnet run"

from the src/API folder, the following happens automatically:
âœ… EF Core Migrations: Any pending migrations are applied to the database.
âœ… Seed Data: A test user and 15 books are inserted if not already present.
âœ… Swagger UI is launched (for testing the API).

### 4.  **How to Access Swagger**
âœ… Once the app is running, the terminal will display output like this:

Now listening on: https://localhost:5163
Now listening on: http://localhost:5164
Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.

âœ…Copy the HTTPS address shown (e.g., https://localhost:5163) and paste it into your browser.

Then append /swagger to it, like this:
https://localhost:5163/swagger

This will open the Swagger UI where you can explore and test all the API endpoints.
ðŸ’¡ If you're using Postman instead of Swagger, also use this same base URL for your API calls

#### 5.**Configuration**
appsettings.json (src/API/appsettings.Development.json)
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=.;Database=LibraryDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}
âœ… Change to match your local SQL Server setup if needed.

### 6.**Entity Framework**
âœ… Migrations are automatically applied on startup.
âœ… No need to run dotnet ef database update manually.

### 7.**Seeded Data**
âœ… Includes test user + 15 law books for testing endpoints.
âœ…Test User (Seeded):
Email: testuser@example.com
Password: Password123

### 8. API ENDPOINTS 
POST /api/auth/register â€“ Register a new user

POST /api/auth/login â€“ Login and receive a JWT

POST /api/auth/logout â€“ Logout and rotate token version(This invalidates token so it cant be used again after logout, user will need to log in again)

GET /api/books â€“ Get all books (with search and pagination support) (authentication required)

GET /api/books/{id} â€“ Get a book by ID (authentication required)

POST /api/books â€“ Add a new book (authentication required)

PUT /api/books/{id} â€“ Update a book (authentication required)

DELETE /api/books/{id} â€“ Delete a book (authentication required)


### 9. **NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE **.........................................................................
âœ… dotnet run must be run from the src/API directory.

âœ… Ensure to update the connection string in appsettings.Development.json to your own appsetting(SSMS was used)

âœ… All error responses are returned in a structured ResultModel<T>.
